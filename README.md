# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the Telco Customer Churn Analysis project aimed at understanding and addressing customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The project focuses on identifying key factors leading to customer churn and developing predictive models to anticipate churn events.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the factors that contribute to customer churn and to develop predictive models that help identify customers at risk of leaving. These insights will enable telecom companies to enhance customer retention strategies, optimize marketing efforts, and ultimately increase customer loyalty.

## Data

The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset that includes customer service usage, billing information, and churn status.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data preprocessing, analysis, and model development.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **Pandas** and **Numpy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Models

I employed several machine learning models to predict churn:
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Random Forest
- KNN
- Naive Bayes
